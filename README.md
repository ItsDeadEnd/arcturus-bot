# arcturus-bot
a bot for discord.

```
because discord.js and discord.js-commando are deprecated this repo is broken.
I'll probably have to rewrite the whole thing if i ever come back to this 
```

to run this bot, clone the project and install node.js if you don't have it already.

ensure you are in the root of the project folder 

before running, you must create a file called options.ini containing your bot info:
```ini
bot_token = YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
owner_id = YOUR_DISCORD_ID_HERE
command_prefix = -
```

to start, run:
```console
node --harmony .
```

have fun.
